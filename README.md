# OpenGNOP!

An open-source remake of Bungie's GNOP! written in JavaScript using the [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) library.

Much of the code is based on [GNOP! Flash](https://github.com/steverichey/gnopflash), but the engine has been completely re-written.

In addition, the code has been simplified, streamlined, and improved wherever possible.  Large assets were removed entirely and are now created dynamically.

## Project goals:
* Extensible interface that can be used for other System 7 projects (OpenOS7)
* Simple, easy-to-use API
* Fast, light, in-browser gameplay
* Standalone executable via [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/)
* Automation and continuous integration via [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)

Contributions to OpenGNOP! and OpenOS7 are highly welcome. Furthermore, if you wanted to spearhead another Bungie remake such as OpenODS, OpenMinotaur, or OpenPID, I'd be happy to help!

OpenGNOP! is intended to emulate Bungie Software’s original [GNOP! 1.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnop!), programmed by [Alexander Seropian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Seropian) in Think C in 1990 for the Macintosh. GNOP! was the first game released by Bungie Software (now just [Bungie](http://www.bungie.net)), although it wasn’t until the 1992 release of [Minotaur: The Labyrinths of Crete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur:_The_Labyrinths_of_Crete) that Bungie was a fully-fledged company comprised of Seropian and fellow classmate [Jason Jones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Jones_(programmer)).

OpenGNOP!, and OpenOS7 (the backbone that contains the core OS functionality) are shared under an MIT license.
