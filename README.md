This file is part of OpenGNOP. OpenGNOP was created by Steve Richey and is a remake of the original GNOP!, released in 1990, which was created by Alexander Seropian. The existence of this program should in no way be construed as approval by Alexander Seropian or Bungie. OpenGNOP is based on GNOP! Flash, with added support for HTML5 and native targets.
